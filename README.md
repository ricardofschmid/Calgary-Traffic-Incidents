# Calgary Traffic Incidents
Traffic incidents for the City of Calgary from 2020 to 2023.

This project was developed as part of my Professional Certificate in Data Science at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. The primary objectives of the project include:

Analyzing traffic incident data to determine peak times (hours) when incidents are most frequent.
Identifying regions with the highest number of traffic incidents.
Detecting trends in traffic incidents over various time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).
Assessing the impact of different weather conditions, such as lower temperatures, on the frequency of incidents.
The project involved comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis using Python.

Please feel free to review the complete project and provide any feedback or suggestions.
